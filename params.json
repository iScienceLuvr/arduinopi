{"name":"Arduinopi","tagline":"Arduino Pi repository","body":"Arduino Pi\r\n=========\r\n\r\nArduino Pi is an Arduino-based computer for developers. The computer is similar to a Raspberry Pi because the Arduino Pi is a single board computer also. The computer has 4 digital pins. The computer has an intepreter designed for Arduino known as Bitlash.\r\n\r\nRepository\r\n=========\r\n\r\nThe repository includes the code, schematic, and PCB files (PCB coming soon). To view the files, go to github.com/iScienceLuvr/arduinopi or press the \"View on Github\" button. The entire project is under the Apache License. \r\n\r\nDeployment\r\n=========\r\n\r\nTo use the code posted in the repository, connect six buttons to the analog pins 0-5 and to the ground. Use a row-column scan LED Matrix (the code supports a 5x5 matrix) and connect them to digital pins 0-9. Refer to the schematic in the github repository\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
