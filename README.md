Arduino Pi
=========

Arduino Pi is an Arduino-based computer for developers. The computer is similar to a Raspberry Pi because the Arduino Pi is a single board computer also. The computer has 4 digital pins. The computer has an intepreter designed for Arduino known as Bitlash (under the MIT License).

Repository
=========

The repository includes the code, schematic, and PCB files (schematic and PCB coming soon). The entire project is under the Apache License. 

Deployment
=========

To use the code posted in the repository, connect six buttons to the analog pins 0-5 and to the ground. Use a row-column scan LED Matrix (the code supports a 5x5 matrix) and connect them to digital pins 0-9.

Contributing changes
=========
